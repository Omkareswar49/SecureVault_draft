Quick Setup Instructions

Install Python dependencies:

bashpip install paramiko

Save the code as server.py
Run the server:

bashpython server.py

Connect from another terminal:

bashssh anything@localhost -p 2222
How It Works

Any username/password will work for now (authentication is disabled for testing)
Port 2222 - standard for custom SSH servers
SQLite database automatically created for storing passwords
Basic menu system with add/retrieve/list functionality

Next Steps for Your Custom Domain
To make it accessible like ssh user@yourdomain.com -p 2222, you need:
Option 1: Cloud Server (Easiest)

DigitalOcean/AWS/Google Cloud - $5-10/month
Upload your script, run it
Access via server IP: ssh user@YOUR_SERVER_IP -p 2222

Option 2: Home Server + Dynamic DNS

Router port forwarding: Forward port 2222 to your computer
Dynamic DNS: Use NoIP.com or DuckDNS for a free domain
Access: ssh user@yourdomain.ddns.net -p 2222

Option 3: Free Cloud (Limited)

Oracle Cloud Free Tier - Permanent free server
Railway/Render - Some have free tiers

Test It First

Run the server locally
Test with ssh anything@localhost -p 2222
Try the menu options (add password, retrieve, list)
Once working, deploy to your server

The minimal version gives you the core SSH server functionality. You can then gradually add encryption, proper authentication, and other features from your original document.
Would you like me to help you set up any specific deployment option or add particular features to this minimal version?RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Ofor now can i do it from my mac?EditAbsolutely! Your Mac is perfect for testing and even hosting this SSH server. Here's how to set it up:
Step 1: Install Python Dependencies
Open Terminal and run:
bashpip3 install paramiko
If you don't have pip3, install it first:
bash# Install Homebrew if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Python
brew install python3
Step 2: Save and Run the Server

Save the code I provided above as server.py
Run it:

bashpython3 server.py
You should see:
Starting Secure Vault SSH Server...
Server listening on port 2222
Step 3: Test Locally
Open a new terminal window and connect:
bashssh anything@localhost -p 2222

Username: anything (any text works)
Password: anything (any text works)

You'll see the menu system and can test adding/retrieving passwords.
Step 4: Make It Accessible from Outside (Optional)
If you want others to connect to your Mac from the internet:
Enable Remote Access:

System Preferences → Sharing → Check Remote Login
Router Setup: Forward port 2222 to your Mac's local IP
Find your public IP: Go to whatismyipaddress.com
Connect: ssh anything@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP -p 2222

Security Considerations for External Access:

Change the default authentication (currently accepts any password)
Use a firewall
Consider VPN access instead

Common Mac-Specific Notes:

Firewall: Mac's firewall might block connections. Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Firewall to allow if needed
Port 2222: This port is usually free on Mac
Background Running: Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
Database: The vault.db file will be created in the same directory

Quick Test Sequence:

Run server: python3 server.py
New terminal: ssh test@localhost -p 2222
Try option 1 (Add password)
Try option 2 (Retrieve password)
Try option 3 (List passwords)

The server will create a SQLite database file (vault.db) in the same directory to store your test passwords.
Want me to help you with any specific part of the setup or add features like proper authentication once you have the basic version working?
